                <p><strong>Create a blog post subtitle that summarizes your post in a few short, punchy sentences and
                        entices your audience to continue reading.</strong></p>

                <p>Welcome to your blog post. Use this space to connect with your readers and potential customers in a
                    way that’s current and interesting. Think of it as an ongoing conversation where you can share
                    updates about business, trends, news, and more. </p>
                <h2>Design with Ease</h2>
                <blockquote><em>“Do you have a design in mind for your blog? Whether you prefer a trendy postcard look
                        or you’re going for a more editorial style blog - there’s a stunning layout for everyone.” </em>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Every layout comes with the latest social features built in. Readers will be able to easily share
                    posts on social networks like Facebook and Twitter, view how many people have liked a post, made
                    comments and more. With Wix, building your online community has never been easier.</p>
                <h2>Create Relevant Content</h2>
                <p>You’ll be posting loads of engaging content, so be sure to keep your blog organized with Categories
                    that also allow readers to explore more of what interests them. Each category of your blog has its
                    own page that’s fully customizable. Add a catchy title, a brief description and a beautiful image to
                    the category page header to truly make it your own. You can also add tags (#vacation #dream #summer)
                    throughout your posts to reach more people, and help readers search for relevant content. Using
                    hashtags can expand your post reach and help people find the content that matters to them. Go ahead,
                    #hashtag away.</p>
                <p> </p>
                <h2>Stun Your Readers<strong> </strong></h2>
                <blockquote><strong><em>“</em></strong><em>Be original, show off your style, and tell your story.”</em>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Blogging gives your site a voice, so let your business’ personality shine through. Are you a creative
                    agency? Go wild with original blog posts about recent projects, cool inspirational ideas, or what
                    your company culture is like. Add images, and videos to really spice it up, and pepper it with slang
                    to keep readers interested. Are you a programmer? Stay on the more technical side by offering weekly
                    tips, tricks, and hacks that show off your knowledge of the industry. No matter what type of
                    business you have, one thing is for sure - blogging gives your business the opportunity to be heard
                    in a way in a different and unconventional way. </p>
