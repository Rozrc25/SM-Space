        <p>
            At SM Space, we are committed to protecting the privacy and security of our users' personal

            using our social media app.
        </p>
        <h2>Information Collection</h2>
        <hr>

            We collect personal information such as name, email address, and profile picture when you create an account.
            Additionally, we may collect data related to your interactions with the app, such as posts, comments, likes,
            and messages.

        <h2>Usage of Information</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The information we collect is used to provide you with a seamless social media experience. It allows us to
            personalize your feed, suggest relevant content, and connect you with friends and other users. We may also
            use your information to send you updates, notifications, and promotional content related to our app.
        </p>
        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>We do not share your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes. However, we may share
            your data with trusted partners and service providers who assist us in delivering the app's functionalities.
            We ensure that these parties comply with strict confidentiality standards.
        </p>
        <h2>Account Settings</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>You have control over the information you share on your profile. You can adjust your privacy settings to
            determine who can see your posts and other activities. We recommend reviewing and updating your settings
            regularly to ensure you are comfortable with the information you share.</p>
        <h2>Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Like most websites and apps, we may use cookies and similar technologies to enhance your user experience.

            unauthorized access, disclosure, or alteration. However, no method of transmission over the internet is
            entirely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.
